# Advent Of Code 2015

I started doing AoC puzzles in 2020. I have a few more days to finish in 2020, but I wanted to start on 2015 as a way to learn more about Golang.
A language which I want to properly learn, and this is a brilliant way of doing just that.

## Day 6
Brute forced solution, it would be good to get a real solution which takes less than a few milliseconds.

## Day 7
Partial solution, misread the instructions, need to rethink it entirely. I actually wrote an emulator for the second set of example instructions

## Day 8
Just started it, not finished as I have to do something else right now.
- Finished it, solution takes less than 1ms to complete. Could have finished it much quicker if I didn't forget to add regular characters onto the end result.
